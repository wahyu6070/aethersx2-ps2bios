<h2>What are the features of aethersx2?</h2>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p><strong>Aethersx2 Emulator</strong> Supports Almost All Platforms such as <b>Android</b>, <b>IOS</b>, <b>Windows</b>, <b>MAC</b> and <b>Linux</b> provided that the platform uses arm64 architecture.</p >
<h3>Controller</h3>
<p><strong>Aethersx2</strong> supports game pad controller for easier playing, it also supports usb and bluetooth connection. but you have to adjust the controller settings in the <i>controller settings</i> menu.</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p><b>AetherSX2</b> has quite complete and efficient graphic support features according to your device's needs, here are some GPU renderers in aetherSX2 : </p>
<ul>
<li><em>OpenGL</em> : tends to be more compatible with a wider range of Android devices than other backends, such as Vulkan, especially on devices with older GPUs or less Vulkan support.</li>
<li><em>Vulkan</em> : designed to take full advantage of hardware capabilities, especially on modern multi-core processors and GPUs. <em>Vulkan</em> often provides more stable results in complex or demanding games compared to other backends. Certain games that may struggle with OpenGL tend to run smoother on Vulkan.</li>
<li><em>Software</em> : used for maximum accuracy when Vulkan or OpenGL has rendering issues, although the performance is much heavier because it uses the CPU instead of the GPU.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resolution Scaling 8X</h3>
<p><em>Resolution Scaling</em> in AetherSX2 refers to the internal resolution multiplier used to render PS2 game graphics. The native resolution of the PS2 is typically around 512x448 pixels or lower, depending on the game and display mode (interlaced or progressive). With this feature, AetherSX2 allows users to increase the internal resolution up to 8 times the original resolution, which significantly enhances visual sharpness and clarity.</p>

<h3>Bilinear filtering</h3>
<p><em>Bilinear filtering</em> in AetherSX2 is an important feature to improve the visual quality of PlayStation 2 games run on Android devices. This feature works by smoothing image textures, reducing pixelation effects, and creating a smoother display.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearest-Neighbor (Point): Without smoothing, the image is sharp but rough.
<li>Bilinear (Forced): Full smoothing, the image is smoother but can be slightly blurry.
<li>Bilinear (PS2): Mimics the original PS2 smoothing, balanced between smooth and sharp.
<li>Bilinear (Forced Excluding Sprite): Smoothing, except for 2D objects (sprites), maintaining their sharpness."
</ul>
<h3>Mipmapping</h3>
<p><em>Mipmapping</em> is a feature in the AetherSX2 emulator to enhance the visual quality of PlayStation 2 games. It utilizes lower-resolution versions of image textures to minimize pixelation and flickering when objects are viewed at a distance.</p>

<h4>Mipmapping Options in AetherSX2:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Automatic (Default): The emulator automatically selects the appropriate mipmapping type.</li>
<li>Off: Mipmapping is disabled, improving performance but reducing graphic smoothness.</li>
<li>Basic (Generate Mips): The emulator generates its own mipmaps.</li>
<li>Full (PS2 Mips): Uses mipmaps provided by the original PS2 game, offering the best graphics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mipmapping improves graphic fidelity, though it might impact performance. Choose the option that best suits your device's capabilities.</p>

<h3>Trilinear Filtering</h3>
<p>Trilinear Filtering enhances texture quality in AetherSX2, the PS2 emulator. This technique smooths textures in three dimensions, reducing visual artifacts and blurriness, especially on distant objects.</p>
<h4>Trilinear Filtering Options:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic (Default): The emulator automatically adjusts trilinear filtering usage, balancing quality and performance.</li>
  <li>Disabled (Off): Trilinear filtering is deactivated, boosting performance at the cost of texture smoothness.</li>
  <li>Enabled (PS2): Mimics the original PS2 trilinear filtering, providing authentic visual representation.</li>
  <li>Enabled (Forced): Trilinear filtering is forcefully applied, yielding smoother images but demanding more device resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Trilinear filtering in AetherSX2 is a crucial feature for graphic enhancement, offering smoother and more realistic texture quality. With options like "Automatic," "Disabled," "PS2," or "Forced," users can tailor their visual experience as needed. Remember, device performance should be considered when enabling this feature.</p>
<h3>Anisotropic Filtering</h3>
<p><em>Anisotropic Filtering</em> is a texture filtering technique that enhances image quality, especially when textures are viewed at oblique angles. It reduces blurriness and preserves texture detail, resulting in a sharper and more realistic display in PS2 games emulated on AetherSX2.</p>
<h4>Anisotropic Filtering Options in AetherSX2:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Disabled (Default): This feature is deactivated, using basic texture filtering.</li>
<li>2x, 4x, 8x, 16x: Anisotropic filtering levels, increasing texture sharpness. The higher the value, the better the quality, but also the greater the burden on the device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commonly asked questions from the aethersx2 community</h2>
<h3>Does aethersx2 support 32bit?</h3>
<p>we only support arm64 (64 bit) architecture so you can't use <b>aethersx2</b> to 32bit devices. but sometimes I see someone porting it to 32bit architecture in the favebook community, but it's not official and developed by the community.</p>
<h3>What is needed to run games on AetherSX2?</h3>
<p>You need the PS2 BIOS file (which you must legally own from your personal PS2 console), game files in ISO or BIN format, and the AetherSX2 application itself. After that, you can load the BIOS and game through the emulator's settings.</p>
<h3>Does AetherSX2 require specific device specifications?</h3>
<p>Yes, for optimal performance, it is recommended to use a device with a mid-range to high-end processor (such as the Snapdragon 700 series or better) and a minimum of 4 GB RAM. Heavier games may require a more powerful device to run smoothly.</p>
<h3>Does AetherSX2 support external controllers?</h3>
<p>Yes, AetherSX2 supports external controllers such as Bluetooth or USB gamepads. You can configure the buttons through the control settings menu in the app for a more comfortable gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Why do some games lag or not run on AetherSX2?</h3>

<h2>PS2 Bios For aethersx2</h2>
<p><a href="https://aethersx2.me/bios">PS2 BIOS</a> is a crucial component for running emulators like AetherSX2, designed to play PS2 games on Android devices. The <a href="https://aethersx2.me/ps2bios">BIOS</a> (Basic Input/Output System) acts as a bridge between the original PS2 hardware and the emulator software. Without the BIOS, AetherSX2 cannot properly initialize the system or process games.</p>
<p>Its importance lies in authenticity and compatibility. The official BIOS from an actual PS2 console ensures the emulator accurately mimics the hardware’s behavior, allowing games to run smoothly without major issues. Additionally, the BIOS manages basic functions like input, graphics, and sound, which cannot be fully replicated by custom code.</p>
