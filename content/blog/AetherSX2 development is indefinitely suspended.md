AetherSX2 development is indefinitely suspended.
Due to neverending impersonating, complaints, demands, and now death threats, I'm done.

You can still download/use the app and it will continue to work for the forseeable future.

AetherSX2 was always meant to be a fun hobby for me, not profit driven. It doesn't make sense to continue working on a hobby which isn't fun anymore.

Stay safe out there, and watch out for scammers, there seems to be a lot of them.

(e.g. there's multiple people claiming to represent AetherSX2 on various social media - they are not legit)

Thanks to everyone who wasn't a d*ck for the last year.

Current build downloads are still available at https://aethersx2.gitlab.io - please follow good security hygiene and don't install APKs from random sources.

## Update 2023/01/10

I no longer have any active online presence in any community. Anyone claiming to be Tahlreth, or represent AetherSX2, is impersonating and scamming you.
I hope the threats and hate will stop now.
This is the development say
